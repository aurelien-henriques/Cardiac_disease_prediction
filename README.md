# Cardiac_disease presence prediction: 

This dataset stored a n = 462 sample of males in a heart-disease high-risk region of the Western Cape, South Africa . The dataset contains the following columns:
sbp : systolic blood pressure
tobacco : cumulative tobacco (kg)
ldl : low densiity lipoprotein cholesterol adiposity
famhist : family history of heart disease (Present, Absent)
typea :type-A behavior obesity
alcohol : current alcohol consumption
age : age at onset
chd : response, coronary heart disease

We tried to study all types of classification models to be able to predict the value of the “chd” response variable (coronary heart disease) given the other variables.
